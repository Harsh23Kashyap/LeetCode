Factorial of a large number
Factorial of a non-negative integer, is the multiplication of all integers smaller than or equal to n. For example factorial of 6 is 6*5*4*3*2*1 which is 720.

We have discussed simple program for factorial.

How to compute factorial of 100 using a C/C++ program? 
Factorial of 100 has 158 digits. It is not possible to store these many digits even if we use long long int. 

Examples : 

Input : 100

Output : 93326215443944152681699238856266700490715968264381621468592963895217599993229915608941463976156518286253697920827223758251185210916864000000000000000000000000

Input :50

Output : 30414093201713378043612608166064768844377641568960512000000000000
Following is a simple solution where we use an array to store individual digits of the result. The idea is to use basic mathematics for multiplication.
