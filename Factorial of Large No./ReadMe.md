Factorial of a large number
Factorial of a non-negative integer, is the multiplication of all integers smaller than or equal to n. For example factorial of 6 is 6*5*4*3*2*1 which is 720.

We have discussed simple program for factorial.

How to compute factorial of 100 using a C/C++ program? 
Factorial of 100 has 158 digits. It is not possible to store these many digits even if we use long long int.
